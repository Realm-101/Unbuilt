# Action Plan Modal Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Tab Visual Indicators
**Problem:** No visual indication of which tab is currently active.

**Solution:**
- Added controlled tab state with `activeTab` and `setActiveTab`
- Applied custom styling to active tabs with orange background (`data-[state=active]:bg-orange-600`)
- Enhanced TabsList background for better contrast (`bg-gray-900/50`)
- Active tabs now clearly stand out with orange color matching the neon flame theme

**Technical Changes:**
```tsx
<Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
  <TabsTrigger 
    value="analysis"
    className="data-[state=active]:bg-orange-600 data-[state=active]:text-white"
  >
```

### 2. ✅ Export Functionality with Page Selection
**Problem:** No export functionality in the modal. Users couldn't export individual pages or select which pages to include.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive export dropdown menu in the header
- Users can select which pages to export via checkboxes:
  - Full Analysis
  - Development Roadmap
  - Market Research
  - Resources
  - Funding Options
- Multiple export formats available:
  - PDF Report (Free)
  - Excel Workbook (Free)
  - PowerPoint Presentation (Pro)
  - JSON Data (Free)
- Pro features are clearly marked with badges
- Export button shows loading state during export
- Success/error toasts provide feedback

**Technical Changes:**
```tsx
// Export dropdown with page selection
<DropdownMenu>
  <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
      <Download className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
      Export
    </Button>
  </DropdownMenuTrigger>
  <DropdownMenuContent>
    {/* Page selection checkboxes */}
    {/* Format selection */}
  </DropdownMenuContent>
</DropdownMenu>
```

**Features:**
- Select all pages or specific pages
- Format-specific file extensions
- Sanitized filenames based on opportunity title
- Pro/Free tier enforcement
- Error handling with user feedback

### 3. ✅ Market Research Integration
**Problem:** Research tab had no direct link to the market research tool for immediate follow-up.

**Solution:**
- Added prominent AI-Powered Market Research CTA at the top of the Research tab
- Gradient background with orange/purple theme for visual emphasis
- Clear call-to-action button that navigates to `/market-research`
- Descriptive text explaining the benefits
- Smooth navigation that closes the modal and redirects

**Technical Changes:**
```tsx
const handleMarketResearch = () => {
  onClose();
  setLocation('/market-research');
};

// In Research tab
<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-900/30 to-purple-900/30">
  <Button onClick={handleMarketResearch}>
    Start Market Research
  </Button>
</div>
```

## New Dependencies Added
- `DropdownMenu` components from `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu`
- `useToast` hook for user feedback
- `useAuth` hook for Pro tier checking
- `useLocation` from wouter for navigation
- Additional Lucide icons: `Download`, `FileText`, `Presentation`, `FileSpreadsheet`, `FileJson`

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- No visual indication of active tab
- No export functionality
- No direct path to market research
- Users had to navigate away to find tools

### After
- Clear orange highlight on active tab
- Comprehensive export with page selection
- One-click access to market research
- Seamless workflow integration

## Export Workflow

1. **Click Export Button** → Dropdown opens
2. **Select Pages** → Check/uncheck pages to include
3. **Choose Format** → PDF, Excel, PowerPoint (Pro), or JSON
4. **Download** → File downloads with sanitized filename
5. **Feedback** → Toast notification confirms success/failure

## Page Selection Logic
- All pages selected by default
- Must select at least one page to export
- Validation prevents empty exports
- Selected pages are highlighted in the dropdown

## Pro Features
- PowerPoint export format requires Pro plan
- Clear visual indicators (Pro badge)
- Upgrade prompt if user tries to use Pro features
- Free users can still export PDF, Excel, and JSON

## Design Consistency
- Matches neon flame theme (orange/purple gradients)
- Consistent with existing modal styling
- Responsive button sizing
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

## Error Handling
- Export failures show error toast
- No pages selected shows warning
- Pro feature attempts show upgrade prompt
- Network errors handled gracefully

## Future Enhancements
- Add email delivery option for exports
- Include custom branding for Pro users
- Add export templates
- Support batch export of multiple opportunities
- Add export history/tracking
