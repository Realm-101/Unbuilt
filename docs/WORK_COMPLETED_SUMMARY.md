## 💬 Your Question

> "I would say to run the full test suite to get some updated statistics seems like the logical choice, Or would you say that is covered when we start executing the new tasks in the spec file"

### My Answer
Running it now was the right call! Here's why:

**Benefits of Running Now:**
1. ✅ Clear baseline before starting new work
2. ✅ Verified Task 23 improvements (+47 tests)
3. ✅ Identified exact gap to 95% (259 tests)
4. ✅ Confirmed no regressions from Task 23

**What We Learned:**
- Current: 1,338 passing (79.6%)
- Target: 1,597+ passing (95%)
- Gap: 259 tests to fix

**Next Steps:**
Start fix-remaining-test-failures spec to close the gap!

---

**Status:** ALL WORK COMPLETE ✅  
**Ready for:** Next phase of execution  
**Recommendation:** Start Task 1.1 of fix-remaining-test-failures spec
