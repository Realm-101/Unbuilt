# Interactive AI Conversations - User Guide

## Overview

The Interactive AI Conversations feature transforms Unbuilt from a one-shot analysis tool into an interactive AI advisor. After receiving your gap analysis, you can engage in follow-up conversations to explore your idea more deeply, ask clarifying questions, and refine your analysis based on new assumptions.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Conversations

1. **Complete a Gap Analysis**: Run a search to generate your initial gap analysis
2. **Scroll to Conversation Interface**: Below your analysis results, you'll find the conversation interface
3. **Start Asking Questions**: Use the input field or click suggested questions to begin

### Your First Conversation

When you first view an analysis, you'll see:
- **Suggested Questions**: 3-5 AI-generated questions tailored to your analysis
- **Conversation Thread**: Empty initially, fills as you interact
- **Input Field**: Type your own questions here

**Example First Questions:**
- "What evidence supports the market demand for this opportunity?"
- "Why haven't existing competitors addressed this gap?"
- "What should be my first step to validate this idea?"

## Using Suggested Questions

### What Are Suggested Questions?

The AI automatically generates relevant follow-up questions based on:

### Question Categories

Questions are organized into categories:

**🎯 Market Validation**

## Analysis Refinement & Variants

### What Are Variants?

Variants are alternative versions of your analysis based on modified assumptions. For example:
- "What if I target the EU market instead of US?"
- "What if I use a subscription model instead of one-time purchase?"
- "What if I focus on enterprise customers instead of consumers?"

### Creating Variants

**Automatic Detection:**
The AI detects when you're requesting a refinement:
- "What if I targeted small businesses instead?"
- "How would this change for the healthcare industry?"
- "What if my budget was $50,000 instead of $10,000?"

**Confirmation Process:**
1. AI identifies refinement request
2. Shows confirmation prompt with modified parameters
3. You confirm to generate new analysis
4. New variant is created and linked to original

### Comparing Variants

**Variant Selector:**
- Switch between original and variants
- See modified parameters for each
- Each variant has its own conversation thread

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**
