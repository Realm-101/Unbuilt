# Interactive AI Conversations - Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What are Interactive AI Conversations?

Interactive AI Conversations allow you to have follow-up discussions with the AI about your gap analysis. Instead of receiving a static report, you can ask questions, explore alternatives, and refine your analysis through natural conversation.

### How do I start a conversation?

After completing a gap analysis:
1. Scroll below your analysis results
2. You'll see the conversation interface with suggested questions
3. Click a suggested question or type your own in the input field
4. Press Enter to send

### Do I need to do anything special to enable conversations?

No, conversations are automatically available for all analyses. Just complete a gap analysis and the conversation interface appears below the results.

## Using Conversations

## Suggested Questions

## Analysis Variants

### What are analysis variants?

Variants are alternative versions of your analysis based on modified assumptions. For example, analyzing the same idea for a different market, customer segment, or business model.

### How do I create a variant?

Simply ask a "what if" question:
- "What if I targeted small businesses instead of enterprises?"
- "What if I used a subscription model?"
- "What if I focused on the European market?"

The AI detects the refinement request and offers to create a variant.

- Enterprise tier: Unlimited variants

### Can I compare variants?

Yes! Use the variant selector to:

- See modified parameters
- Compare innovation scores and gaps

### Do variants have separate conversations?

Yes, each variant has its own conversation thread. This keeps discussions focused and organized.

### Can I delete variants?

Yes, you can delete variants you no longer need. The original analysis is always preserved.

## Response Quality

### How accurate are AI responses?

The AI provides responses based on:
- Your specific analysis data
- Market research and trends
- Business best practices
- Logical reasoning

However, AI responses should be used as guidance, not absolute truth. Always validate critical decisions with additional research.

### What if the AI gives an incorrect response?

You can:
- Point out the error in a follow-up question
- Rate the response with thumbs down
- Report the response if it's significantly wrong
- Contact support for persistent issues

### Why does the AI include disclaimers?

Disclaimers appear for:
- Financial projections (not financial advice)
- Legal considerations (not legal advice)
- Success predictions (no guarantees)
- Assumptions made in responses

This ensures you understand the limitations and use responses appropriately.

### Can the AI provide sources for its claims?

Yes, when making specific claims about markets, competitors, or trends, the AI cites sources when available. Look for source citations in responses.

### What does "confidence level" mean?

Confidence indicators show how certain the AI is:
- **High**: Based on clear data from your analysis
- **Medium**: Reasonable assumptions made
- **Low**: Speculative or uncertain

## Conversation Management

### How long are conversations saved?

Conversations are saved indefinitely with your analysis. You can return to them anytime.

### Can I search within a conversation?

Yes, use the search feature within the conversation interface to find specific messages or topics.

## Best Practices

### How can I get better responses?

1. **Be Specific**: Include constraints, budgets, timelines
2. **Provide Context**: Reference specific analysis sections
3. **Ask Follow-Ups**: Dig deeper into interesting points
4. **Use Variants**: Explore different scenarios
5. **Build on Previous Answers**: Create a logical flow

### What's the best conversation flow?

A good flow typically:
1. Starts with market validation questions
2. Explores competitive landscape
3. Dives into execution strategy
4. Addresses specific concerns
5. Creates variants for alternatives

### How do I organize long conversations?

- Use clear conversation to reset when changing topics
- Create variants for different scenarios
- Export important conversations for reference
