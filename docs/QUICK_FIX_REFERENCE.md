## 📝 What Still Needs Work

### Email Service Integration (Optional)
To actually send emails, add one of these:

**Option 1: SendGrid (Easiest)**
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Option 2: AWS SES (Cheapest)**
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
```

**Option 3: SMTP (Most Flexible)**
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Then update `server/routes/export.ts` sendEmailReport function.

## 🎨 Export Formats Explained

| Format | What You Get | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| PDF | HTML file | Print to PDF in browser |
| Excel | CSV file (.xlsx) | Opens in Excel, not true .xlsx |
| JSON | JSON file | Perfect for APIs |
| PowerPoint | HTML slides | Convert to .pptx with online tools |

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Saving doesn't work
- Check database connection
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors

### Export fails
- Check server logs for error details
- Verify results array is not empty
- Check network tab for response

### Email shows "queued" but nothing happens
- This is expected! Email service not integrated yet
- Check server logs to confirm request received
- See "Email Service Integration" above

### Share modal still has issues
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check if dark theme CSS loaded

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Integrate email service** - Make emails actually send
2. **Add result detail page** - Make share links work
3. **Upgrade export libraries** - Use real Excel/PPT generators
4. **Add export history** - Let users re-download past exports
5. **Add saved result folders** - Organize saved items

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Excel exports**: Open the .xlsx file in Excel, it works even though it's CSV
- **PowerPoint exports**: Use print-to-PDF or online converters to get .pptx
- **Share links**: They work for sharing but need a detail page to view
- **Email reports**: Backend logs the request, just needs service integration
