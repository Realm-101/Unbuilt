# Perplexity AI - Decision Guide

## The Question: Should We Keep Using Perplexity?

You mentioned being unsure why Perplexity was the primary selection initially. Let me break this down.

---

## Why Perplexity Was Originally Chosen

### The Key Advantage: Real-Time Web Search
Perplexity's unique value proposition is **real-time web search integrated with LLM reasoning**. This is critical for:

1. **Current Market Data** - Stock prices, trends, news
2. **Recent Events** - Product launches, company announcements
3. **Live Statistics** - Market sizes, growth rates
4. **Competitive Intelligence** - What competitors are doing NOW
5. **Trend Validation** - Is this actually trending or outdated?

### Your Use Case: Market Gap Discovery
When users search for "untapped opportunities in healthcare," you need:
- ✅ Current healthcare trends (not 6 months old)
- ✅ Recent regulatory changes
- ✅ Latest startup launches (to avoid suggesting existing solutions)
- ✅ Real market data and statistics
- ✅ Current consumer complaints and pain points

**This is exactly what Perplexity excels at.**

## Three Options for You

### Option 1: Keep Perplexity (Recommended) ✅

**Use:** `sonar-pro` model (already updated in code)

**Pros:**
- Real-time web search capability
- Best for current market intelligence
- Specialized for research tasks
- Good balance of cost and quality

**Cons:**
- Additional API to manage
- Extra cost (~$3-5 per 1M tokens)
- Another potential point of failure

**When to Choose:**
- If real-time market data is critical
- If you want the most current information
- If users expect up-to-date insights

**Cost:** ~$3-5 per 1M tokens

---

### Option 2: Switch to Gemini 2.5 Pro Only

**Remove Perplexity, use only:** `gemini-2.5-pro-latest`

**Pros:**
- One less API to manage
- Gemini 2.5 Pro has built-in search capability
- Simpler architecture
- Potentially lower costs

**Cons:**
- Gemini's search is not as specialized as Perplexity
- May not be as current with market data
- Less focused on research tasks

**When to Choose:**
- If cost is a major concern
- If you want simpler architecture
- If 80% accuracy is good enough

**Cost:** ~$1.25-5 per 1M tokens (similar to Perplexity)

---

### Option 3: Use Perplexity Search API + Your Own LLM

**Use:** Perplexity Search API for data, then Gemini for analysis

**Pros:**
- More control over search results
- Can optimize costs by separating search and reasoning
- Potentially better quality (best tool for each job)

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires code changes
- More API calls = more latency

**When to Choose:**
- If you want maximum control
- If you're optimizing for cost at scale
- If you have time for implementation

**Cost:** Variable, potentially lower at scale

---

## My Recommendation: Keep Perplexity (Option 1)

### Why?

1. **Your Core Value Prop:** Finding untapped market opportunities
   - This REQUIRES current, real-time data
   - Outdated data = suggesting ideas that already exist
   - Users expect fresh insights

2. **Competitive Advantage:**
   - Real-time market intelligence is a differentiator
   - Most competitors use static LLMs
   - You can offer more current insights

3. **User Experience:**
   - "This opportunity emerged last month" > "This was a gap in 2024"
   - Current trends = more actionable insights
   - Better validation of market gaps

4. **Already Implemented:**
   - Code is already set up
   - Just needed model name update (done)
   - Fallback to Gemini already works

5. **Cost is Justified:**
   - ~$3-5 per 1M tokens is reasonable
   - Quality improvement justifies cost
   - Critical for your core feature

## Architecture Recommendation

```
User Query: "Find gaps in healthcare"
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRIMARY: Perplexity sonar-pro          │
│  - Real-time web search                 │
│  - Current market data                  │
│  - Recent trends and news               │
│  - Live competitive intelligence        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓ (if Perplexity fails or unavailable)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FALLBACK: Gemini 2.5 Pro               │
│  - Deep reasoning and analysis          │
│  - Comprehensive insights               │
│  - Built-in search (less specialized)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓ (if both fail)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAST RESORT: Demo Data                 │
│  - Keeps app functional                 │
│  - Development/testing                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This gives you:**
- Best quality (Perplexity for current data)
- Reliability (Gemini fallback)
- Always functional (demo data)

## Cost Comparison

### Scenario: 1,000 market gap searches per month
Average tokens per search: ~3,000 input + 2,000 output = 5,000 total

**Option 1: Perplexity + Gemini (Current)**
- Perplexity: 1,000 searches × 5,000 tokens = 5M tokens
- Cost: 5M × $4/1M = $20/month
- Gemini fallback: ~10% = $2/month
- **Total: ~$22/month**

**Option 2: Gemini Only**
- Gemini: 1,000 searches × 5,000 tokens = 5M tokens
- Cost: 5M × $3/1M = $15/month
- **Total: ~$15/month**
- **Savings: $7/month**

**Option 3: Search API + Gemini**
- Search API: 1,000 searches × $0.005 = $5
- Gemini analysis: 5M tokens × $3/1M = $15
- **Total: ~$20/month**
- **Savings: $2/month**

### Verdict
**$7/month savings is NOT worth losing real-time market data for your use case.**

## When to Reconsider

You should reconsider Perplexity if:

1. **Cost becomes prohibitive** (>$500/month on Perplexity alone)
2. **Gemini's search improves significantly** (monitor Google's updates)
3. **Your use case changes** (no longer need real-time data)
4. **Perplexity quality degrades** (monitor output quality)
5. **Better alternatives emerge** (new AI search tools)

## Final Answer to Your Question

**"I am unsure why this was the primary selection initially"**

**Answer:** Perplexity was chosen because your app's core value is finding **current, untapped market opportunities**. This requires:
- Real-time market data ✅
- Current trends and news ✅
- Live competitive intelligence ✅
- Recent consumer insights ✅

Perplexity specializes in exactly this - web-grounded, real-time research. It's the right tool for the job.

**Should you keep it?** 
**Yes.** The cost is justified by the quality and relevance of insights. Real-time market data is critical for your use case.

**Alternative?**
If cost becomes an issue, try Gemini 2.5 Pro only for 1-2 weeks and compare output quality. But I predict you'll want Perplexity back.
